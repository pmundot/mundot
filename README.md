<h1>Welcome </h1>

<p>I am a Data Scientist/ Data Engineer looking to futher my skill sets and work on making some amazing projects.</p>
<p>There is not a lot of difference between data and oil. You need to extract and refine it to put it to use. As a chemical engineer turned data scientist, I'm a problem solver by nature. I spend my days digging into algorithms to determine how processes would fair in real world settings. I'm curious and dedicated to uncovering new information. There's always more to learn.</p>
